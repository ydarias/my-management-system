# Project Context

When working with this codebase, prioritize readability over cleverness. Ask clarifying questions before making architectural changes.

## About This Project

## Standards

- We write one class per file, instead of grouping multiple TS classes in the same file.
- The domain models live inside the use-cases module.
- The commit messages should describe functional change instead of technical details.
- The test files should be named depending on their scope:
  - When containing unit tests it should be file-name.test.ts
  - When containing integration tests it should be file-name.spec.ts
